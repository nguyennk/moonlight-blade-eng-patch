# Known bugs

This is still WIP so there will be a lot of translation error, let me know if you spot something that doesn't sound right. Feel free to suggest translation text change in issue ticket

Some translation got cut off, so it might not mean anything, report/feedback if you encounter something you need to understand to proceed, will try to include in the next patch when I have time

# Feedbacks

There are still a lot of things need to be translate, this is WIP
Please submit issue ticket if you think something need to be translate to help with understanding the game better
